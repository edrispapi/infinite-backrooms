# Template Selection Guidelines

[WARNING!] THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL TEMPLATE, DON'T USE IT!

Use this template when the user explicitly asks for a very simple, framework‑free single page app:
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS only, no React, Vite, or bundlers
- Visualizations, demos, or tiny games (e.g., 2048, Tetris)
- Zero backend or only trivial `/api/*` routes

Avoid this template when the user needs:
- Component libraries, routing, or build tooling → prefer other templates
- Server frameworks, durable objects, or agents → choose a DO/Agents template

Built for the fastest “just show a page” scenarios.
